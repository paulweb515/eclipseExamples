CSS Styling
- I'm Paul, Platform UI lead and committer for almost 10 years
- I'd like to talk about in depth about the styling engine
- - How the IDE makes use of the sytling engine
- - How the styling engine translates CSS to SWT calls
- I'd like to talk about hooking up your own CSS with your RCP app
- I'd like to talk about how you can interface with the Color and Font themes
- I'd like to talk about extending the engine yourself
- I'd like to talk about some of the tools that can help with CSS
- I'd like to talk about some things available from the community

What is the styling engine?
- it allows the user to control the look of the UI based on CSS
- you define CSS rules.  
- - The selectors determine when the rule is applied to each widget
- - The properties specify what you want styled in the widget
- this can be used to switch around the look of the Application without a lot of code changes
- Also: while we provide SWT property handlers, the core engine is headless and could target other widget sets.

Anatomy of a styling engine
- Talk about parsing the style sheet
- create CSSRules
- get the shells from the display
- apply styles to the shells and all of the widgets
- once the properties for a widget are known, the SWT prop handlers are called
- They call the correct SWT methods.

Styling Selectors
- selectors can be type, class, or ID
- we allow the SWT type
- we allow classes set on the widget
- we allow an ID set on the widget.  The ID must be unique
- in Eclipse4 and Luna, anything rendered from a model element gets the model type and tags added as classes

CSS Cascade
- controls how styles are determined for different rules
- styles cascade down to each element from multiple sources
- they come from external style sheets, inline style blocks, and element style declarations
- Our styling engine can handle a cascade, including inline styles, but we don't expose any API to do it
- We take advantage of the cascade to group all common styles in one style sheet, and include that in a platform specific style sheet
- The Styling engine follows the CSS concept of specificity to determine which rule's property gets applied if there's a collision

Specificity
- CSS styles can cascade from multiple sources
- The properties that are applied to a widget are the union of multiple style rules
- CSS needs a way to deal with the same property coming from multiple rules.  That's specificity.
- Each part of the selector is evaluated and weighted to give a specifity value
- In the case of collision, the property from the rule with the higher specificity value is applied.
- There are resources for this later.

Property Handlers: Control
- We have the style decorations from the rule(s)
- We have the widget
- we need to do something to the widget
- that's where property handlers come in
- the prop handler maps the property+value to the actual SWT call on the widget.
- We have examples on our wiki pages.
- Here are some on Control
- They can be called on any instanceof Control

Property Handlers: CTabFolder
- has the most handlers to support SWT specific styling properties
- i.e. swt-simple determines how the tabs are presented
- i.e. swt-single can put it into single-tab mode, or unibrow as I like to call it

Property Handlers: Label
- It supports all of the properties for Control as well as it's own alignment
- There are more examples of property-to-method mappings on the wiki

Where is the code?
- it's located in these 3 plugins
- One is the core engine/parser
- one provides the SWT property handlers
- one provides managing style sheets as themes, loading them within eclipse

Themes for your application
- when defining the theme, you need a label, ID, and stylesheet
- there are also 3 optional properties: ws, os, and os_version
- themes without these properties are valid for all platforms
- multiple themes can have the same ID as long as one or more of the properties are specified
- This is the way to specify platform specific themes.
- while you only provide one base style sheet in the extension, you can still use multiple style sheets
- Include them at the beginning of your theme style sheet
- applicationCSSResources tells the engine where to go look for resource files, like images references in the style sheet

Create a Theme - step 1
- It's not hard to contribute a theme with a style sheet into an existing Application
- it takes 3 steps
- create a plugin

Create a Theme - step 2
- write a style sheet
- here I'm targetting different widgets by their type contained in their view ID
- notice change the '.' to '-'
- reference a color definition, more on that later

Create a Theme - step 3
- add the extension point.
- If you control your RCP app, you can fill in the CSS properties in the product extension
- the theme extension makes it available on the Appearance pref page
- within the IDE, the quickest way to switch to the new theme is to use Window>New Window
- this only works well if you don't care about your perspectives, or you've already saved them

Some things that can be themed
- Structurally within eclipse, here are some parts
- you can target specific widgets with class or ID

CSS vs 3.x themes
- 3.x had the notion of themes
- managed color and font definitions
- contributions (views and editors) could allow look customization by publishing colors or fonts through these themes
- changed their contents, plus things like decorators, content assist, etc

Roger's themes
- Roger Dudler is well known in the eclipse community. - He has lots of 3.x color themes

Roger's themes
He has lots of 3.x color themes, available for download
- When Juno came out he created a dark theme, called Dark Juno.
- potentially get a hold of the theme and show a pic
- it's possible to combine this theme with some of the other themes on the eclipsecolorthemes site
- show pick with open java editor.


Jeeyul's Chrome theme
- This is an example of a community member using the Styling Engine.
- He put together the Chrome theme for Juno which is much more than a regular style sheet
- The Chrome plugin provides a UI which allows users to select their styling choices
- A great way to modify the preferences
- can also be combined with 3.x themes.
